<h1>Task Manager API (NodeJS)</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This application was created as part of "The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)" by Andrew Mead on Udemy (I completed this course in April 2020): <br>
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/</p>
<p>The application allows user to create, read, update and delete tasks. The API is using a number or technologies learned during this course:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MongoDB with Mongoose</li>
<li>Using Middlewares (user Authentication)</li>
<li>Password encryption - using bcryptjs</li>
<li>Sending emails - using SendGrid</li>
<li>Unit Testing - using jest</li>
</ul>
